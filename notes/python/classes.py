# python namespace is a mapping from names to objects
# E.g.,builtin namespace (interpretter startup), global namespace (created when read in), function local namespace (on call)
# declarations in a namespace are attributes (. operator)
import sys

# behaves as object
print(sys)
sys.stderr

# What are the python scopes again?
# innermost (local) scope, enclosing functions, globals, built-ins
# scoped are static, but name resolution is dynamic (this is possibly changing)
# assignment and del add and remove bindings (that word again) and go to local scope
# import and function decl bind names in local scope

# Scoping example
def python_scope() :
    def local_scope() :
        scam = 'local scam'

    def nonlocal_scope() :
        # non local will continue up functions until first found variable
        nonlocal scam
        scam = "nonlocal scam"

    def global_scope() :
        # no previous binding
        global scam
        scam = 'global scam'

    scam = 'python scam'
    print('local scope:', scam)

    local_scope()
    print('local assignment:', scam)

    nonlocal_scope()
    print('nonlocal assignment:', scam)

    global_scope()
    print('global assignment:', scam)

print('global scope:', scam)

# Allows: inheritance, multiple base classes, override methods, call base class methods

# like functions must be executed (encountered before use)
class bird :

# class definitions create a new namespace and local scope

# Like function, and othe things in python classes are objects

# Classes can be modified at runtime
# All normal members are public and all methods virtual
# builtins can be base class
# operators can be overloaded

# objects are aliased when assigned (or passed, another way to think about the pass by object-reference)

# data attributes override method attributes with same name
# Python does not support data hiding (convention does)
# Class functions need not be declared in a class

# Inheritence (Base name may be module.classname)
# Scoping: If attribute not resolved in class, searches base class (applied recursively)

# no private, but leading underscore is convention for private
